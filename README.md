This task was set as part of [the Trilogy Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development](https://skillsforlife.edx.org/coding/frontend/landing/?s=Google-Unbranded&pkw=web%20design%20training&pcrid=624628533241&pmt=p&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GGL%7CSKILLS-FOR-LIFE%7CSEM%7CCODING%7C-%7COFL%7CTIER-1%7CALL%7CNBD-G%7CBMM%7CPrimary%7CSubject-Matter&utm_term=web%20design%20training&s=google&k=web%20design%20training&utm_adgroupid=140443158663&utm_locationphysicalms=1006886&utm_matchtype=p&utm_network=g&utm_device=c&utm_content=624628533241&utm_placement=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqc6aBhC4ARIsAN06NmMdwBRSe3BLeaChkukN5Bbqb18220k1ku9TB2o9tzsX0xYUc-dlRWgaAuyvEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). The first commit includes the starter files we were provided in their intial state. The point of the exercise was to refactor these files to meet accessibility standards. The criteria for success were:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

The initial refactoring work was undertaken by a group of four students - Lili Begum, Ian Cheng, Petru Arcana and myself. Each of us then went on to complete the task in our own time.

[The refactored site](https://paulashby.github.io/code-refactor) has been deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Installation

If for any reason you would like to deploy the website yourself, simply fork this repository, go to the Settings page of your fork on GitHub and set the 'Branch' dropdown to 'master'.

## Usage

Assuming this repository will be used to step through each stage of the exercise, please proceed as follows:

If you would like to view the files in their intial state, check [the initial commit](https://github.com/paulashby/code-refactor/tree/6201088738a3d3fe73649b35595a185c8b682826).

[This](https://github.com/paulashby/code-refactor/tree/d2d186694ad3504f9ddba9235b6bbc76c876ac57) is where we'd got to after the first session, working as a team of four.

Check [the final result](https://github.com/paulashby/code-refactor/tree/2b6f560980660abb1cefd817a37427979954d181) to browse the files in their refactored state.
